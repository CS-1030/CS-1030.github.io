# CS-1030 with Ruiz
{: .fs-9 }

Welcome students!
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---
I created this site as a quick programming reference for my students as they complete my coursework. It is not an exhaustive Python tutorial, nor is it a replacement for our approved textbook.

### Navigation
- In the left menu, you'll find programming topics organized into sections. 
- In the top navigation bar, you can use the search bar to find specific information.

### Programming Feedback
I have created and deployed two "code bots" that live in our assignment repositories. Each time you submit (commit) your solution file, They both scan your program for any possible errors. They will comment their observations in the **Pull Request** tab, under the **Feedback** conversation. I hope the instant feedback and clues they give will help everyone with the hardest part of programming, debugging.

### Python Links

2. [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html): The definitive reference on anything and everything Python.
3. [Repl.it](https://repl.it/~): An online, fully featured IDE that allows you to program anywhere you have internet access, even if you can't install software on your machine. 
4. [SoloLearn Tutorials](https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1073): A free, high-quality, and interactive tutorial I often recommend to students.
5. [GitHub](https://github.com/):
