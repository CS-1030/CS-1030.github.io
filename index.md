Welcome students!

## Getting Started

### About

I created this site as a quick programming reference for my students as they complete my coursework. It is not an exhaustive Python tutorial, nor is it a replacement for our approved textbook.

### Navigation

On the navigation menu to the left, you'll find programming topics organized into sections. You can also use the search bar on the top navigation menu.

### Student Links
1. [Python Tutor](): An excellent visual debugger that lets you step through your program one line at a time. You can see exactly what is happening in memory, allowing you quickly identify and fix logic errors. 
2. [Python Docs](): The definitive reference on anything and everything Python.
3. [Repl.it](https://repl.it/~): An online, fully featured IDE that allows you to program anywhere you have internet access, even if you can't install software on your machine. 
4.
