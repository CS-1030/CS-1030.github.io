## Want to contribute? Have an idea?
- I am 100% open to ideas, requests, fixes, and code contributions. [Here's how](https://github.com/CS-1030/CS-1030.github.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

## Current Features
- Website automatically redeploys with every push.
- More pages can be added to the website by creating another page in the _pages directory.
  - Use an existing page as a template.
- This repo is the "parent" of [CS-1400](https://github.com/CS-1400/CS-1400.github.io). All changes made here go "downhill" as well.
