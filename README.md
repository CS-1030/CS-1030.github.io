> I created this website as a reference for my students as they complete their programming assignments.

## Want to contribute? Have an idea?
- I am 100% open to ideas, requests, fixes, and code contributions. [Here's how](https://github.com/CS-1030/CS-1030.github.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

## Current Features
- Website automatically redeploys with every push.
- More pages can be added to the website by creating another page in the _pages directory.
  - Use an existing page as a template.
- Interactive code snippets are embedded html via [repl.it](https://repl.it/~). 
- This repo is the "parent" of the [CS-1400](https://github.com/CS-1400/CS-1400.github.io) fork. All changes made here go "downhill" as well.
  - The fork autosyncs with this repo on a [set schedule](https://github.com/CS-1400/CS-1400.github.io/blob/5d96ab0aab5ba341a4c32d6387de9154f0e773d0/.github/workflows/fork-news.yml#L6). 
  - If you fork this repo for your own purposes, you will also be able to sync up automatically and get all the updated goodness (as a pull request for your review, of course). Follow the directions for creating your own automated upstream syncing [here](https://github.com/VitorNoVictor/fork-news/blob/main/README.md).
