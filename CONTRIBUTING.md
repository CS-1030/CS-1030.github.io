# Contributing
I'd love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Proposing new content
- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Discussing the current state of the code
- etc

## I Develop with GitHub
I use GitHub to host code, to track issues, and to implement changes through pull requests.

## I use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. 

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/pmarsceill/pmarsceill/issues)
I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/CS-1030/CS-1030.github.io/issues/new); it's that easy!
