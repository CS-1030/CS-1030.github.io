# Functions

## Definition
A function is a prewritten block of code with a name. We call it by name to execute it. Functions optionally contain:
  - **arguments**: the function's input; data given to the function enclosed within the parenthesis.
  - **return**: the function's output; data passed back to the line of code that called it.

## Built in functions
Below is a table of functions we learn in CS-1030. For a full list of built-in functions, refer to the [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
