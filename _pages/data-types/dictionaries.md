## Description
A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs enclosed by curly braces ({}). A colon (:) separates each key from its value.
- **Mutable**: you can change any of their attributes.
- **Keys**, like index numbers, allow access to individual values. They must be an immutable data type.
- Many different actions (methods and functions) can be performed on dictionaries.
