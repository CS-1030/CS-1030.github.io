## Description
Built-in functions are pre-installed with the Python language. They do not need to be imported or created by the programmer. Common built-in functions are `print()`, `input()`, and `length()`
- Python Docs: [Built-in Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)

## Invocation
When invoking (calling/executing) a function, you type it's name followed by opening and closing parenthesis. 
- **Arguments**: Some functions accept arguments (input), which are placed inside the parenthesis. 
- **Return Value**: Some functions produce output, and return it to its caller.
