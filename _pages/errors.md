## Definition
There are three types of errors we encounter while programming: syntax, runtime, and logic. 
- [Python Docs: ]()

## Syntax Erros
Syntax errors are caused by not following the rules of the language. Examples: beginning a variable name with a number, forgetting to close parenthesis or quotes, or misspelling keywords. The editor will usually bring these to your attention by underlining them in red. You cannot execute your program until you fix these errors.

## Runtime Errors
Runtime Errors (called **exceptions**) happen during program execution, and cause your program to crash. They are caused by asking the computer something it cannot do, such as division by zero or trying to access the 5th character of a four character string.

## Logic Errors
Logic errors occur when the program runs fine, there are no obvious errors, but the output is incorrect. This can be caused by incorrect algorithms, or mistyping an operator (ex: + instead of -).

## Exception Handling

Python Code:
{% highlight python %}
def main():

    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
{% endhighlight %}
